      "text": "Together we will create brave space\nBecause there is no such thing as a “safe space”\nWe exist in the real world\nWe all carry scars and we have all caused wounds.\nIn this space\nWe seek to turn down the volume of the outside world,\nWe amplify voices that fight to be heard elsewhere,\nWe call each other to more truth and love\nWe have the right to start somewhere and continue to grow.\nWe have the responsibility to examine what we think we know.\nWe will not be perfect.\nThis space will not be perfect.\nIt will not always be what we wish it to be\nBut\nIt will be our brave space together,\nand\nWe will work on it side by side"
